/**
 * This method returns the client application which is attempting to get the
 * accessToken. The client is normally found using the clientID & clientSecret
 * and validated using the clientSecrete. However, with user facing client applications
 * such as mobile apps or websites which use the password grantType we don't use the 
 * clientID or clientSecret in the authentication flow.  Therefore, although the client
 * object is required by the library all of the client's fields can be  be null. This 
 * also includes the grants field. Note that we did, however, specify that we're using the
 * password grantType when we made the* oAuth object in the index.js file.

 * @param {string} clientID used to find the clientID
 * @param {string} clientSecret used to validate the client
 * @param {function} callback The callback takes 2 parameters. The first parameter is an error of type falsey
 * and the second is a client object. As we're not retrieving the client using the 
 * clientID and clientSecret (as we're using the password grantt type) we can just 
 * create an empty client with all null values. Because the client is a hardcoded 
 * object - as opposed to a clientwe've retrieved through another operation - we just 
 * pass false for the error parameter as no errors can occur due to the aforemtioned
 * hardcoding.
